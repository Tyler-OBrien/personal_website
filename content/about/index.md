Hi! I'm Tyler O'Brien, a developer located in the Upstate New York region. I'm currently interested in Cloudflare's ecosystem, including Workers, D1, Durable Objects, Workers Analytics Engine, and more. I've been a part of a few game server communities in the past, and have used C# and .NET's Ecosystem  extensively. I hope to learn languages like Rust in the future. I am currently aiming for a Bachelor's in CS, and already have my associates.

You can read more about some of my [Projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "My Projects"), and [blog posts]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "My Blog Posts").
