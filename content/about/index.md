Hi! I'm Tyler O'Brien, a developer located in the Upstate New York region. I'm currently interested in Cloudflare's ecosystem, including Workers, D1, Durable Objects, Workers Analytics Engine, and more. 

You can read more about some of my [Projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "My Projects"), and [blog posts]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "My Blog Posts").

You can find a self-hosted non-cloudflare copy of this site at [tobrien.dev](https://tobrien.dev).


This website was build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Congo](https://git.io/hugo-congo), a Hugo theme.
