Hi! I'm Tyler O'Brien, a developer located in the Upstate New York region. I'm currently interested in Clickhouse and Cloudflare's ecosystem, including Workers, D1, Durable Objects, Workers Analytics Engine, and more. I primarily use C# and JS/TS.

You can read more about some of my [Projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "My Projects"), and [blog posts]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "My Blog Posts").

You can find a self-hosted non-cloudflare copy of this site at [tobrien.dev](https://tobrien.dev). Original Cloudflare powered at [tylerobrien.dev](https://tylerobrien.dev)

This website was build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Congo](https://git.io/hugo-congo), a Hugo theme.

You can reach me at tyler @ this site.
